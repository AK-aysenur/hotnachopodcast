                <p class="para">Heyyy guys, my name is Aminata, one of the co-host in our Podcast. 
                    I'm a huge fan of true crime and love finding out different twisted stories. 
                    Also I'm nothing related to true crime so I'm just a big fan!!! When I'm not working 
                    you can find me watching the latest documentaries or books about true crime. 
                    True crime just fascinates me, the unsolved mysteries and stories. I hope you will like our Podcast.

                <p class="para">Hi everybody! I'm Nur and I'm currently studying criminology at University of Amsterdam. I as a person 
                    like to know everything and by that I mean 'eager to learn' everything. While I was studying I worked on 
                    a lot of cases and got the idea to start this podcast with my friend from another career background. 
                    So I hope you can enjoy our podcast!

                <p class="para">Hi fellow crime lovers! My name is Nive and I'm one of the co-host of this podcast. I've started this 
                    podcast with Nur and Aminata, because I love gorey, spine-shivering and crazy crime stories. I have watched 
                    Sam and Colby, Buzzfeed unsolved and Rotten Mango forever and loved the idea of starting a podcast. So here we are, 
                    three crime loving lads with a passion for talking and sharing! I hope you like our episodes and support us to make 
                    more!
